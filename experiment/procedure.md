## Procedure

To perform an SDS-PAGE experiment, the following steps must be followed.

1. Casting of the SDS-PAGE resolving gel.
2. Casting of the SDS-PAGE stacking gel.
3. Preparation of the protein samples.
    1. Dilute the samples with loading buffer and add the 4X tracking dye in the ratio 3:1 to get 40-50Î¼L
    total sample.
    2. The protein samples are heated at 95 degree Centigrade for 15-20min, then centrifuged at 11000rpm for
3min before loaging into the SDS-PAGE gel.  

4. Setting up the apparatus for SDS-PAGE.
5. Electrophoresis 
6. Staining and visualization
   1. After washing with water, add stain (containing Comassie brilliant blue) to the gel. Keep in rocking
      condition for 2-3 hrs.
   2. Then wash off the stain with water and add destain, keep under rocking condition for 4-6 hrs and visualize.
