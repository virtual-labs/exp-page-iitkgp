### About the Experiment 

Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis is used to separate biomolecules based on their differential
electrophoretic mobility under a constant electric field due to differences in their mass. Among the different
types of PAGE, BN-PAGE (Blue native-PAGE) is used to study protein complexes in their native state. Here,
all the interactions between proteins in their folded form are retained. SDS-PAGE (Sodium dodecyl sulphate-
PAGE) is used to separate denatured proteins uniformly coated with the anionic detergent SDS so that all the
interacting monomers are separated and the electrophoretic mobility is influenced only by the mass of the
protein molecules.
